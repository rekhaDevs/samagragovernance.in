          We combine a top-down management consulting approach for problem
          structuring with a bottom-up understanding of the governance ecosystem
          for designing solutions, while leveraging data and technology to
          enable implementation of our solutions, with the objective of making
          governments accountable and deliver with minimum delays and maximum
          efficiency.

        text: >-
          We are a mission-driven governance consulting firm. We firmly believe
          in governance being the primary lever of change to create large scale
          impact in the country. We work with the senior political and
          bureaucratic leadership of states to solve governance problems at
          scale. From the time we are approached with a problem statement, we
          cowork with the government to diagnose the challenge, design a
          transformation roadmap and implement the same. The solutions we
          develop are rooted in the realities of governance in India. All our
          engagements are typically two-three year-long systemic transformation
          programmes.
