      Since its inception in 2012, Samagra has been working with governments at
      various levels across the country. We have synthesized our learnings from
      these 10 years in the form of two frameworks–The Governance Matrix and
      Panchsutras for Governance Transformation. These frameworks will be useful
      for those working in the government as well as for those working with the
      government.

      The Governance Matrix is a tool to determine the readiness of a government
      (national, state or local) to drive outcomes as a function of political
      salience (political will) and system capacity (people, processes and
      infrastructure).
