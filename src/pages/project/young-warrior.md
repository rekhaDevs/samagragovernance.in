      The Young Warrior NXT program aims to equip 14-18 year-old students with
      foundational life skills for future readiness and emotional well-being.
      Along with serving students and helping them build skills for the future,
      this program also enables the identification of scalable implementation
      models for imparting life skills training. The program is anchored in
      Yuwaah, a UNICEF-incubated platform. Samagra is creating the overall
      strategy for the program, supporting technical partners with research and
      design as well as coordinating and managing partners from the ecosystem to
      ensure the program delivers on its target of imparting life skills
      training to 50 lakh youth.

  - text: >-
      The Young Warrior NXT program aims to help young people gain life skills
      for better academic, workplace and life outcomes. A two-pronged approach
      is being taken to achieve this goal. Through 11 tasks across 5 life skills
      on the Young Warrior NXT Bot, which was launched in August 2021, we are
      targeting 5 lakh learners within a year. Simultaneously, we are curating
      scalable pilots for imparting life skills training that require low levels
      of facilitation, deliver impact and will scale up successful solutions and
      institutionalize life skills training.
impact:
  - count: 10 lakh
    label: Youth to be engaged
  - count: 5 lakh
    label: Learners to be reached in one year
