      How does a state go about transforming its entire education system? This
      was precisely the goal the Government of Haryana set for itself in 2017,
      when it launched Saksham Haryana, its flagship programme aimed at
      improving the quality of education in the state and making 80% students in
      classes 1-8 grade-level competent, or Saksham in all government schools in
      the state. Currently, Samagra’s Saksham Haryana-Education team, with
      support from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, works with the Chief
      Minister’s Office and the Department of Education to design and implement
      state-wide interventions to facilitate attainment of grade-level
      competency in the state to enable the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
      in Haryana. The first phase of this engagement concluded in May 2019, with
      86% of students in classes 3,5 and 7 declared grade-level competent in
      Hindi and Math. Currently, for elementary grades, the team is working on
      post COVID remediation and overhauling of state conducted assessments. In
      secondary grades, the team’s focus is on e-Adhigam, Haryana’s tablet based
      learning program which is also India’s largest Ed-Tech program in govt
      schools.

approach:
  - text: >-
      Samagra’s approach to transforming school education combines both academic
      and administrative reforms. This means we focus as much on improving the
      quality of classroom interactions between students and teachers (through
      remedial classes, assessment reforms, shifting focus from syllabus
      completion to competency-based teaching, tech-based assessments,
      large-scale tablets program), as on making the education system
      administratively more efficient (by ensuring optimum teacher availability
      in schools, robust review and monitoring mechanisms, ongoing mentoring and
      training support for teachers). These academic and administrative reforms
      are combined with accountability initiatives such as cascaded review and
      monitoring mechanisms and third-party assessments, to keep track of
      progress and carry out timely corrective action.
