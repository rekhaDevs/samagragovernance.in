  - text: >-
      How does a state go about transforming its entire education system? This
      was precisely the goal the Government of Haryana set for itself in 2017,
      when it launched Saksham Haryana, its flagship programme aimed at
      improving the quality of education in the state and making 80% of
      government school students in elementary classes grade-competent, or
      Saksham. Samagra’s Saksham Haryana-Education team works with the Chief
      Minister’s Office and the Department of Education to design and implement
      state-wide interventions to translate this vision into tangible results.
      The first phase of this engagement concluded in May 2019, with 86% of
      students in classes 3,5 and 7 declared grade-level competent in Hindi and
      Math. The next wave is focused on sustaining the Saksham status of
      students across Grades 3 to 8 in all 119 blocks in Haryana as well as
      improving the quality of education in secondary classes.

      Samagra’s approach to transforming school education combines both academic
      and administrative reforms. This means we focus as much on improving the
      quality of classroom interactions between students and teachers (through
      remedial classes, assessment reforms, shifting focus from syllabus
      completion to competency-based teaching), as on making the education
      system administratively more efficient (by ensuring optimum teacher
      availability in schools, robust review and monitoring mechanisms, ongoing
      mentoring and training support for teachers).

        As students move to higher classes without mastering learning outcomes
        of the previous one, the gap between their actual learning levels and
        what they are taught in the classroom keeps widening. It is thus
        necessary to provide students with the requisite support to bridge this
        learning gap and gain mastery over learning outcomes from previous
        classes. To mitigate this challenge Haryana has implemented a
        state-wide, structured remedial classes under the Learning Enhancement
        Program. LEP is a continuous remedial programme in Math, Hindi and
        English for students in Classes I to V, conducted throughout the
        academic year. It caters to 10 lakh students in all 8,556 government
        primary schools across the state. Remedial classes are conducted during
        the first 45 minutes of a school day, with the schedule of lessons
        aligned with content taught in the classroom.

        The overarching objective of this intervention is to make all
        stakeholders within the education system (teachers, state, block and
        district officials) accountable for the attainment of student learning
        outcomes. However, accountability requires measurement of performance
        which in turn rests on the availability of accurate data student
        assessment and from academic monitoring visits made by education
        officials. In 2017, the Government of Haryana launched a tech-based
        Academic Monitoring System (AMS) that allows mentors and monitors
        visiting schools to capture insights from their visits on an AMS App.
        State-wide data is collected from this App, analysed and made available
        on a dashboard that can be viewed by stakeholders across the education
        system, from the Chief Minister to a teacher. This data is used
        extensively during review meetings conducted at the state, district and
        block levels to identify problems areas that require corrective action.

        The Government of Haryana has built a robust, user-friendly dashboard
        collect, digitize, and analyse data from student assessments. Within 15
        days of an exam, teachers collate marks for all students. A
        representative or data entry operator from each school logs into a data
        entry portal integrated with the state MIS to record assessment scores.
        The data is used to generate performance reports at the school, teacher,
        block, district and state level. This provides an accurate picture of
        student performance to all stakeholders and helps build transparency and
        public accountability.

        The Saksham Ghoshna campaign was launched in December 2017 to devolve
        ownership and accountability to blocks for ensuring that 80% of students
        in each block became grade-level competent. Blocks that meet the bar are
        declared Saksham and felicitated. The overarching objective of Saksham
        Ghoshna is to generate momentum at the block level by creating a sense
        of healthy competition among blocks. To ensure transparency, an
        independent, third-party conducts the assessment to test for
        grade-competency, and not the state government. As the recognition for
        success of a block is given directly to key stakeholders within the
        system, they are motivated to meet the target, truly believing that
        their glory lies in their hands. After 8 rounds of Ghoshna assessments
        between December 2017 and May 2019, 90% of the blocks in Haryana (107
        out of 119 blocks) are now Saksham.
