approach:
  - text: >-
      Our approach in this engagement has three elements. At the core of this
      effort is setting up robust back-end systems related to g-governance,
      analytics, database of citizens, services and schemes, etc., that form the
      bedrock of all technological interventions. The citizen-facing element of
      our approach aims at creating front-end touchpoints--web portals, mobile
      apps and physical service centres through which citizens interact with the
      government. Linking these two elements are enablers that focus on managing
      state servers, building the capacity of government departments and
      improving the overall digital literacy of citizens.

        Harpath is a mobile app allowing citizens to upload photos of road
        potholes, register a complaint and hold the relevant government
        department accountable for fixing them. The Digital Haryana Cell has
        facilitated mapping of 1.5 lakh roads managed by 7 different government
        departments on ISRO's GIS Platform 'Bhuvan', now available on the app.
        Every road is mapped to a relevant engineer. After downloading the app,
        users are expected to register themselves. After registration, they can
        take a picture of a pothole and upload it. A grievance, once registered,
        is marked directly to the concerned engineer. After receiving the
        complaint, the government has three days to acknowledge the complaint
        and another seven days for resolving it. Users can also check the status
        of their complaint on the app.

        Saksham Tech is an initiative aimed at bringing HR management processes
        of the Department of Education online, with the objective of doing away
        with the physical service books of employees that contain the profile
        and professional history of the employee. It captures key details such
        as promotions, leaves and transfers. As a result of this initiative,
        service books of 1.25 lakh employees of the Education Department
        including teachers are being brought online. This will ensure secure
        digital records of all staff members, easily accessible for both the
        Department of Education and employees.
