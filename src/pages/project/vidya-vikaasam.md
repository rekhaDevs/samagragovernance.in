      The key objective of Vidya Vikaasam was to improve learning outcomes of
      students in government schools in Andhra Pradesh by 6-8% through
      data-backed reviews and cascaded accountability mechanisms. Between 2017
      and 2019, Vidya Vikaasam’s initiatives touched 17 lakh students in the
      state and 25,000 teachers. Data-backed decision-making was embedded in the
      higher levels of the school education department, with assessment data
      being used by the department leadership for conducting reviews and taking
      policy decisions.

      There were three broad levers through which the engagement's objectives
      were sought to be achieved. First, an assessment framework to build the
      capacity of the Department of Education to create, conduct and analyse
      high quality assessments. Second, strengthening direct levers of learning
      level outcomes such as remedial teaching, teacher training and academic
      monitoring. Third, setting up systems to close the assessment feedback
      loop by sharing the results of high-quality assessments with teachers and
      parents for corrective action.

      text: "Successive large scale assessments showed that there was a fall in the learning levels of students in the state as they progressed through their years in school. This was a problem that affected the lives of students adversely, and the state found it imperative that measures be taken to address this issue in the short term. Towards this end, it was decided that a remedial programme named Gnana Dhaara shall be launched. This was a summer remedial programme that was targeted at students transitioning from Class 5 to Class 6, and Class 9 to Class 10. Gnana Dhaara had three objectives. First, curbing dropouts. A dropout predictive model designed by Microsoft for the state of Andhra Pradesh analysed that 82% of all dropouts occur due to difficulties faced in being able to cope up academically.\_Second, developing an academic bridge programme for transitioning students. And third, engaging students productively during summer."

        Since the inception of the Continuous and Comprehensive Examination
        (CCE) pattern in 2010, the state's Department of School Education had
        been collecting formative and summative assessment data of students from
        all the schools. However, little attempt was made towards systematically
        using the data and deriving data backed insights on the performance of
        students and gaps in learning till 2016-17, when a step in this
        direction was taken through the digitization of the data collection
        process. Steps towards using assessment data towards operational and
        policy-related processes picked up steam with the Vidya Vikaasam
        engagament, wherein it was decided that an Assessment Dashboard would be
        developed which would provide assessment analytics to all concerned
        stakeholders. Thus, a completely functional assessment dashboard that is
        being regularly used by both the department and field personnel towards
        a number of activities was created.
