      Samagra is conducting a 6-month diagnosis & design exercise in Gujarat and
      Odisha with the aim of improving accessibility, quality and speed of care
      in the public healthcare facilities. This is part of the “Tribal Health
      Collaborative'' formed by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Piramal
      Foundation to improve health outcomes of tribal and other marginalised
      communities. This diagnosis and design exercise is being undertaken in
      Assam, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan. These six
      states have a relatively higher tribal population in the country. The end
      objective of the programme is to create a roadmap for transforming the
      public healthcare service delivery system in these six states using a
      state-driven systemic approach.

approach:
  - text: >-
      To identify key areas of intervention, the team is using the “Means,
      Motives and Opportunities” (MMO) approach which is based on the philosophy
      that a system can deliver on its intended outcomes only if each actor in
      the system has the required means, motives and opportunities to perform
      her role well. With a focus on the MMO of all key actors in the primary,
      secondary and tertiary health facilities of the government (District
      Hospitals/Sub-district Hospitals/Community Health Centres/Primary Health
      Centres/Sub-Health Centres), the team will do a detailed diagnosis of the
      health facilities in both states across 9 key areas. Recommended in the
      Indian Public Health Standard guidelines, these include Expanded service
      delivery, Continuum of care, Community engagement, Infrastructure, Meds
      and Diagnostics, HR Management, Robust IT systems, Partnerships and
      Financing reforms.
