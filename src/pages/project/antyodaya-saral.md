overview:
  - text: >-
      Imagine a citizen seeking information on or wanting to apply to a
      government service or scheme. One immediately pictures a confused citizen
      waiting in a long line at a government office unsure of process or
      progress. It is to change precisely this perception that the Government of
      Haryana decided to develop an online public service delivery platform,
      Antyodaya Saral, that would redefine citizen-government interaction in the
      state.
  - text: >-
      Antyodaya Saral allows a citizen to apply for more than 500 schemes and
      services across 36 Government Departments. Besides the online platform,
      there are 115 physical touchpoints called Saral Kendras which provide the
      same services, besides Common Service Centres across more than 6,000
      villages in Haryana.

approach:
  - text: >-
      Our approach to streamlining public service delivery in Haryana was rooted
      in achieving three things: accessibility, convenience and efficiency. This
      meant that the citizen can get all information related to scheme or
      service in one place, apply for it without even having to visit a
      government department and get regular updates on application processing.
      For a government official this meant receiving applications from one
      source in one format rather than from multiple sources, ensuring maximum
      time is spent on processing applications rather than public dealing and
      receiving feedback from citizens on service provided. Instead of roping in
      a costly vendor, we worked with the Government of India’s Service Plus
      platform that was easy to use, configure and integrate with existing tech
      systems and scalable. An overarching principle driving this engagement was
      establishing accountability and transparency so all data from the
      Antyodaya Saral platform is available on a public dashboard that shows the
      performance of departments and districts with respect to processing time
      for applications.

        Public service delivery across the country is mired with delays and
        corruption due to information assymmetry between government and
        citizens. There are 500+ citizen facing services/schemes cutting across
        36 departments, where each department has its own way of running
        operations. To streamline this key element of government-citizen
        interaction for 2.5 crore citizens of Haryana, Antyodaya Saral provides
        all these schemes/services of these 36 departments on a single,
        integrated online platform. This platform is also used at government-run
        service centres and Common Service Centres. This unprecedented
        initiative has eliminated the middleman and enabled a more transparent,
        efficient, paperless and citizen-responsive service delivery system.
        More than 50 lakh applications have been received through this platform
        till date.

        There are more than 6000 Common Service Centres across Haryana that
        provide all 500+ schemes and service available online. This represents a
        paradigm shift in access to government for citizens living in the most
        remote parts of the state. Simultaneously it ensures that a citizen
        living in the village is as empowered as one in a city.

        The Saral dashboard allows department officials to view compliance of
        their staff with timelines notified under Haryana Right to Service Act
        of 2014 at the state as well as district level. This gives them insight
        into whether services are being delivered in a time-bound manner. The
        dashboard provides an inter-district,-department and -service comparison
        of performance against Right to Service timelines as well as which step
        of application processing is taking the most time. It is used by the
        Chief Minister’s Office to review the performance of departments. To
        further drive accountability, after the completion of every service, an
        automatic IVRS-based feedback call is made to each applicant. This
        allows citizens to provide feedback on their experience using the online
        portal or at a service centre.

        A state-wide helpline has been set up to resolve service and
        scheme-related queries and grievances for 2.5 crore residents. The
        helpline is operational from 7am-9pm from Monday to Saturday. The
        helpline receives more than 1 lakh calls per month.
