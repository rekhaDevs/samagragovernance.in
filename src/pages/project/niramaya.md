      Samagra, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is working
      with the Government of Uttar Pradesh to reform nursing and paramedical
      training in the state. UP has over 4.4 lakh registered medical
      professionals. These include 1.1 lakh doctors, 0.25 lakh dentists, 2.29
      lakh nurses, 0.80 lakh paramedics. Apart from the professionals currently
      practicing in the state, there is an annual pipeline of nearly 70,000
      medical students, studying in 800+ colleges. There are currently many
      programs running for the upskilling of in-service medical professionals.
      However, the objective of this program is to improve the quality medical
      education with a focus on creating a cadre of better skilled nursing and
      paramedical graduates.

      Samagra’s approach to improving the quality of medical education for
      nurses and paramedics is to push for five core administrative and
      technical reforms. These are accreditation of medical training
      institutions, institution of centralized admissions, introduction of
      competency-based assessments, verifiable e-credentials and making the
      allied healthcare profession aspirational. All the reforms shall also
      drive the adoption of a digital platform compliant with the Ayushman
      Bharat Digital Mission. This digital-first approach will bring about
      efficiency in the functioning of training institutes, Human Resources in
      Health regulator, and greatly benefit the students.
