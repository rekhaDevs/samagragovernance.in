overview:
  - text: >-
      Uttar Pradesh has the largest school education system in India. Over the
      last few decades, while the state has achieved near universal school
      enrollment, learning outcomes of students remain poor as highlighted by
      several reports such as NAS and ASER. Keeping in line with the draft New
      Education Policy, the state government has recognized the importance of
      ensuring universal acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy,
      i.e., ability to read with meaning and solve for basic maths, as key to
      improving the quality of education. To this end, Samagra’s Mission Prerna
      team is working with the Government of Uttar Pradesh to ensure that all
      primary school students are able to attain foundational literacy and
      numeracy skills by 2022.

approach:
  - text: >-
      Samagra’s approach to transforming school education combines both academic
      and administrative reforms. This means we focus as much on improving the
      quality of classroom interactions between students and teachers (shifting
      focus from syllabus completion to competency-based teaching,  providing
      ongoing mentoring and training support for teachers, improving quality of
      teaching learning material), as on making the education system
      administratively more efficient (reducing teacher and student absenteeism,
      introducing an efficient teacher transfer mechanism, strengthening field
      offices). These academic and administrative reforms are combined with
      accountability initiatives such as cascaded review and monitoring
      mechanisms and third-party assessments, to keep track of progress and
      carry out timely corrective action.
