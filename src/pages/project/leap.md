overview:
  - text: ' Samagra has been working with the Departments of Agriculture and Farmers’ Empowerment (DAFE) and Fisheries & Animal Resources (F&ARD), Govt of Odisha, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), over the past 4 years on multiple agri-centric interventions. Building on top of earlier success, LEAP (Livestock Expansion & Advancement Program) was conceptualized to focus on increasing the income of livestock farmers through two animal husbandry value chains i.e. Dairy and Goatery. Samagra’s role is to develop a holistic design to achieve the income enhancement objective and execute it over 3 years to deliver palpable change on ground.'

approach:
  - text: >-
      Samagra’s approach to improving farmer’s income is through having targeted
      missions i.e. Odisha Milk Mission and Odisha Goat Mission. Each of these
      missions will have a set of technical interventions. The Dairy Mission,
      for instance, includes technical interventions such as animal induction,
      balanced nutrition and breed improvement. Additionally, administrative and
      ecosystem interventions such as healthcare digitization, credit
      facilitation and community organization activation will cut across both
      missions. Lastly, baseline, midpoint and endline income monitoring will
      help maintain a razor sharp focus on the overall goal of the program.
